# CHIP-8
## Implementation(s) (yet another (and some more?)) of the CHIP-8 interpreter!

Just a project started out by aiming towards getting a hold on C++. 

Resources for the project:

1. Primarily guided by: https://austinmorlan.com/posts/chip8_emulator/
2. However, as Point 1 claims, there is another reference that Point 1 follows - http://mattmik.com/files/chip8/mastering/chip8.html
3. An extension of Point 2 can be found at - https://github.com/mattmikolay/chip-8/wiki
4. The argument for using the reference in Points 2 and 3 _(and not the Cowgod reference that is more easily found)_ is presented well through the comments (by RodgerTheGreat) in this Reddit post by Bisqwit: https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3ca4ry/writing_a_chip8_interpreteremulator_in_c14_10/csu7w8k/

More resources can be found by going through the above four in detail (quite a rabbit hole for people interested in emulation of older machines).
